User Stories Bookmarks contain:

title url link description rating (1-5) I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required) I can select from a dropdown (a element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
